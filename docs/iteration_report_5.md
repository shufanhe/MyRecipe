   - Frontend for user account page - make it user accessible.
   - Updated redirect to better html page rather than give 401 page.
3. Diana:
   - Implement user preferences - decided to go with the tag route. Having issues with the schema and how to structure it in the database. I will go to office hours this week to get help with this.
   - Front-end categories - having issues with how to format the recipes since we are using a for loop to add them.

Troubles/Issues/Roadblocks
----------------
1. Struggling with bootstrap, formating the cards that we are using for recipes. Formating things in the correct position, sometimes they don't land in the exact position we need. Sizing of pictures, for example logout button was huge, had to work on sizing it correctly.
2. Diana - Schema/database. Adding tags is something new to me specifically adding it to our database and joining things together. I need to get extra help to work on this.
3. Adding the feature of uploading an image. It was a new thing that Shufan was working on and it kind of got her stuck, but asked Khanh for help.

Adjustments to Overall Design
----------------
1. Added a new feature of allowing users to follow each other.
