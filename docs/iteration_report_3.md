One Important Thing Learned

2. Don't get stuck on one thing and try to figure it out on your own. ASK FOR HELP!

Explanation
----------------
1. We decided to implement admin_user function to insert an admin user to the database because we don't want to register a new one every single time we run the application
2. For the same reason as above, we will write a new function to insert 30 new recipes from recipe website
3. We were busy with personal and class work, so it was hard to balance this project with our other work. However, we should be able to come back to normal this week to work on our application a lot better.
